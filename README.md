# Python to VHDL Converter

Welcome to the Python to VHDL Converter, a Python-based tool designed to facilitate the conversion of Python code into VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). This tool serves as a transpiler, transforming Python code expressions into VHDL expressions suitable for hardware implementations.

## Introduction

This tool aims to bridge the gap between software and hardware design by providing a streamlined approach for engineers and developers. It enables the translation of Python algorithms and functionalities into hardware descriptions compatible with FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) implementations.

By integrating Python and VHDL, this converter allows for rapid prototyping, enabling the efficient transformation of software concepts into hardware designs. Users can leverage the simplicity and flexibility of Python programming while harnessing the robustness and efficiency of VHDL for hardware development.

## Features

- Converts Python code to VHDL expressions
- Facilitates rapid prototyping for hardware design
- Bridges the gap between software and hardware development
